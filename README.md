# coursera-courses
This repo contains all the code I have written for any of the free online courses offered by Coursera.org. Each file represents a separate class or subset of classes.

## python_web_data

This class was taught by Charles Severance at the University of Michigan. Using Python to Access Web Data showed how to "treat the internet as a source of data". The course covered the basics surrounding scraping, parsing, and reading web data as well as using web APIs.

## machine_learning

This folder contains all work completed in the pursuit of the Machine Learning Specialization offered by the University of Washington. The course was taught by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox, Amazon Professors of Machine Learning Computer Science and Engineering and of Statistics respectively.
The specialization covers in order:
- A Case Study
- Regression
- Classification
- Clustering & Retrieval
- Recommender Systems & Dimensionality Reduction
The Case Study is meant to be a lite overview of all of the topics later covered in the specialization and does not go as in depth as the later more specific topics do.

## The Future

Hopefully in the future I will be able to add Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class to the current machine_learning folder or perhaps a separate one. I also hope to find a decent functional programming class on Coursera as that seems to be something of increasing interest.
